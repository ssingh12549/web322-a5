    <h1>Code Explanation</h1>
    
    <h2>main.hbs Explanation</h2>
    <p>The main.hbs file serves as the main layout template for your web pages.
      It includes the common structure and elements that are shared across multiple pages.
      By using the Handlebars templating engine, you can dynamically inject content into specific sections of the layout.
      This allows for modular and reusable code, improving development efficiency.
    </p>

    <h2>AddEmployee.html Input Elements Explanation</h2>
    <p>
        The addEmployee.html file contains a form for adding employee data.
      It includes several input elements to capture information such as the employee's first name, last name, email, address, and status.
      These input elements provide fields where users can enter the corresponding data.
      The form also includes a submit button to trigger the submission of the employee data.
      JavaScript code can be added to validate the input values before submitting the form to ensure data integrity.
    </p>
    
    <h2>CheckLastName() Function Explanation</h2>
    <p>
        The checkLastName() function is responsible for validating the last name input field in the addEmployee.html form.
      It checks if the last name contains only alphabetic characters.
      If the validation fails due to the presence of non-alphabetic characters, the function displays an error message, sets the focus back to the last name input field, and returns false.
      This prevents the form from being submitted and prompts the user to correct the input.
      If the validation succeeds and the last name contains only alphabetic characters, the function returns true, allowing the form submission to proceed.
